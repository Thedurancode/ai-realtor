# 🚀 AI Realtor Platform - Perfect for Your AI Assistant Setup!

**Real Estate Agents - Are You Ready to Take Your AI Assistant to the Next Level?**

We've been building something powerful, and I want to share it with fellow agents who are serious about leveraging AI to grow their business.

## 🏠 What Is It?

We built the **AI Realtor Platform** - a complete backend API that turns your AI assistant (like Clawbot) into a full-fledged real estate operations center. It's not just a chatbot - it's an intelligent assistant that actually **does work** for you.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Most agents have AI that can *chat*.

This AI can:

🔹 **Generate property videos** with voiceovers
🔹 **Scrape property data** from any listing URL
🔹 **Score deals** so you know where to focus
🔹 **Auto-send contracts** and track signatures
🔹 **Skip trace owners** and automate outreach
🔹 **Run Facebook ads** with AI-generated copy
🔹 **Schedule social posts** across all platforms
🔹 **Predict deal outcomes** with confidence

## 🎤 Voice Control Examples

*P.S. The contract sending actually works - watched Richard Burke open the contract 5 minutes after we sent it. The future is already here.* 🤯
