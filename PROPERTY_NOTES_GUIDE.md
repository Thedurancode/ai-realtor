## How to Add Notes

The easiest way! Just talk to the bot naturally:

**The bot will:**

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific** - "Seller wants $850k firm" vs "Price info"
- **Include dates** - "Roof replaced 2023" vs "New roof"
- **Add context** - "Buyer pre-approved $900k, looking in Brooklyn"
- **Update regularly** - Keep notes current
- **Use categories** - Seller, Property, Buyer, Dates, Repairs
- **Link to actions** - "Schedule inspection" not just "Inspection"

### ❌ DON'T:
- Vague notes like "Follow up" (when? why?)
- Duplicate information
- Outdated notes (delete or update old ones)
- Irrelevant personal opinions
- Sensitive financial info (keep it professional)
