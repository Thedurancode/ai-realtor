# First-Time Home Buyer Coach

## Overview

This skill provides specialized coaching for first-time home buyers. It guides agents through educating buyers who have never purchased a home before, covering everything from pre-approval to closing.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- Working with buyers who have never purchased a home
- Buyers seem overwhelmed by the process
- Explaining complex real estate concepts
- Creating educational content for buyers
- Setting realistic expectations

## The First-Time Buyer Journey

### **Phase 1: Pre-Purchase Education (Weeks 1-2)**

#### **1.1 Initial Consultation**

**Cover these topics:**
- **Budget Reality Check**
  - How much can they actually afford?
  - Monthly payment vs. purchase price
  - Hidden costs (insurance, taxes, HOA, maintenance)

  **Example Script:**
  ```
  "Let's start with your budget. Many first-time buyers focus
  on the home price, but what matters is your monthly payment.
  On a $400K home with 10% down:
  - Mortgage: ~$2,900/month
  - Property tax: ~$400/month
  - Insurance: ~$150/month
  - Total: ~$3,450/month

  Is this comfortable for you, or would you prefer to start lower?"
  ```

- **Credit Score Impact**
  - Minimum scores for different loan types
  - How to improve score before applying
  - Pre-approval vs. pre-qualification

  **Key Point:**
  ```
  "Pre-approval means a lender has verified your finances
  and is ready to lend. Pre-qualification is just an estimate.
  Sellers take pre-approval seriously."
  ```

- **The Buying Team**
  - Real estate agent (you!) — Your advocate
  - Lender — Handles financing
  - Home inspector — Finds issues
  - Attorney (in some states) — Legal review
  - Title company — Handles paperwork

#### **1.2 Understanding Mortgages**

**Explain loan types simply:**

| Loan Type | Down Payment | Credit Score | Best For |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **FHA** | 3.5% | 580+ | Lower credit, lower down payment |
| **Conventional** | 3-20% | 620+ | Better rates, higher credit |
| **VA** | 0% | Varies | Veterans, military |
| **USDA** | 0% | 640+ | Rural areas, moderate income |

**Common First-Time Buyer Questions:**

**Q: "Should I put 20% down?"**
```
A: "Not necessarily. 20% avoids PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance),
but many buyers put down 3-10%. Let's compare:
- 20% down: Higher upfront cost, no PMI, lower monthly payment
- 5% down: Lower upfront cost, PMI (~$200-300/month), higher payment

If you have the cash, 20% saves money long-term. If not,
5% down gets you into a home sooner, and you can refinance
later when you have more equity."
```

**Q: "What's PMI?"**
```
A: "PMI is insurance you pay for the lender's benefit if you
put down less than 20%. It protects them if you default.
It costs about 0.5-1.5% of the loan amount annually.

On a $380K loan with 5% down:
- PMI ~$200-400/month
- Goes away when you reach 20% equity
- Can be removed by refinancing or paying down principal"
```

### **Phase 2: House Hunting (Weeks 3-8)**

#### **2.1 Creating the Wish List**

**Help buyers prioritize:**

**Must-Haves (Non-negotiable):**
- Budget range
- Minimum bedrooms/bathrooms
- Location/commute
- School district (if applicable)

**Nice-to-Have (Flexible):**
- Garage
- Updated kitchen
- Large backyard
- Move-in ready

**Deal-Breakers (Avoid):**
- Major foundation issues
- Flood zone
- High HOA fees (if budget is tight)

**Exercise: The "Needs vs. Wants" Matrix**
```
Create a 2x2 matrix:

Must Have + Can Afford → Priority 1 (Top of list)
Must Have + Can't Afford → Reconsider budget
Nice to Have + Can Afford → Look for deals
Nice to Have + Can't Afford → Skip

This helps buyers understand trade-offs.
```

#### **2.2 Viewing Properties Effectively**

**Teach buyers what to look for:**

**Exterior Red Flags:**
- Roof condition (shingles curling, missing)
- Foundation cracks (especially step cracks)
- Drainage issues (water pooling, mold on siding)
- Window/door condition (rot, difficulty opening)

**Interior Red Flags:**
- Water stains on ceilings (leaks)
- Soft spots in floors (water damage)
- Odors (musty = mold, pets = potential damage)
- Electrical (old wiring, not enough outlets)
- Plumbing (low water pressure, slow drains)

**The "30-Minute Rule":**
```
"Take 30 minutes to view a home:
- 5 minutes: Walk through every room
- 10 minutes: Check systems (water, lights, AC/heat)
- 10 minutes: Look for red flags listed above
- 5 minutes: Discuss impressions and ask questions

Don't rush — this is likely the biggest purchase of your life!"
```

### **Phase 3: Making an Offer (Week 9)**

#### **3.1 Determining Offer Price**

**Explain the strategy:**

**In Seller's Market (low inventory):**
- Offer at or above asking
- Minimize contingencies
- Short closing timeline
- Write a personal letter to seller

**In Buyer's Market (high inventory):**
- Start 5-10% below asking
- Ask for concessions (closing costs, repairs)
- Longer closing timeline if needed
- More contingencies for protection

**The "Comparable Sales" Explanation:**
```
"Comps (comparable sales) tell us what similar homes
recently sold for. We look at:
- Same neighborhood (within 0.5 mile)
- Similar size (±200 sqft)
- Similar age (±10 years)
- Sold in last 3-6 months

This gives us realistic market value. If a home is priced
above comps, we negotiate. If below, we move fast."
```

#### **3.2 Contingencies Explained**

**Common contingencies and when to use them:**

| Contingency | Purpose | First-Time Buyer Advice |
|-------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Inspection** | Check for issues | Always include — protects you |
| **Financing** | Lender approval | Include if not pre-approved |
| **Appraisal** | Home value check | Include if putting down <20% |
| **Sale of Home** | Sell current home | Avoid if possible — weakens offer |

**Script for explaining contingencies:**
```
"Contingencies are outs — they let you back out if something
goes wrong, without losing your deposit.

For first-time buyers, I recommend:
1. Inspection contingency (always)
2. Financing contingency (if not fully pre-approved)
3. Appraisal contingency (if down payment <20%)

These protect you. In a competitive market, you might waive
some, but only if you're comfortable with the risk."
```

### **Phase 4: Under Contract (Weeks 10-12)**

#### **4.1 Home Inspection 101**

**Prepare buyers for the inspection:**

**What inspectors check:**
- Structural (foundation, walls, roof)
- Systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
- Appliances (if included)
- Safety (smoke detectors, railings)
- Pest/termite inspection

**Attending the inspection:**
```
"I recommend attending the inspection. It takes 2-3 hours,
and you'll learn so much about the home:
- How systems work
- Where shut-offs are
- Maintenance tasks
- Future repair priorities

Bring a notepad and ask questions. Inspectors are teachers —
they want you to understand the home."
```

#### **4.2 Negotiating Repairs**

**Three approaches to repair requests:**

1. **Ask seller to fix** — Common for major issues
2. **Request credit at closing** — Buyer controls repairs
3. **Accept as-is** — Lower price, no repairs

**Script for repair negotiation:**
```
"Based on the inspection, we found:
- Roof needs replacement ($12K) — Major issue
- Outdated electrical ($4K) — Safety concern
- Minor cosmetic issues ($500) — Normal wear

We can:
1. Ask seller to fix roof/electrical (you choose contractor)
2. Request $16K credit at closing (you manage repairs)
3. Split: Seller fixes roof, credit for electrical

For first-time buyers, I recommend option 2 (credit).
You control quality and timing."
```

### **Phase 5: Closing (Weeks 13-14)**

#### **5.1 The Final Walkthrough**

**What to check:**
- [ ] Repairs completed (if negotiated)
- [ ] No new damage since inspection
- [ ] Systems working (heat, AC, water, electrical)
- [ ] Appliances included and working
- [ ] Clean and vacant (if seller moved out)
- [ ] No unexpected debris

**Timing:** Do this 24-48 hours before closing.

#### **5.2 Closing Day Preparation**

**Documents to bring:**
- ID (driver's license or passport)
- Proof of insurance
- Cashier's check for closing costs
- Any documents requested by lender

**What to expect:**
```
"Closing takes 1-2 hours. You'll sign:
- Loan documents (mortgage, promissory note)
- Deed (transfers ownership)
- Affidavits (legal statements)
- Disclosures (property condition, lead paint, etc.)

Bring questions! The closing agent explains everything,
but don't be afraid to ask if you don't understand."
```

## Common First-Time Buyer Mistakes

### **Mistake #1: Buying Too Much House**
**Problem:** Maxing out budget leaves no room for unexpected costs.
**Solution:** Stay 10-20% below pre-approval limit.

### **Mistake #2: Skipping Pre-Approval**
**Problem:** Fall in love with home, can't afford it.
**Solution:** Get pre-approved before house hunting.

### **Mistake #3: Waiving Inspection**
**Problem:** Buy home with expensive issues.
**Solution:** Always inspect, even in competitive markets.

### **Mistake #4: Ignoring Location**
**Problem:** Great house, terrible neighborhood.
**Solution:** Research area at different times of day.

### **Mistake #5: Not Budgeting for Closing Costs**
**Problem:** Surprised by 2-5% of purchase price in fees.
**Solution:** Plan for closing costs upfront.

## Educational Scripts for Buyers

### **"The True Cost of Homeownership"**
```
"Beyond your mortgage, expect:
- Property taxes: $3,000-6,000/year
- Home insurance: $1,000-2,000/year
- HOA fees: $0-500/month (if applicable)
- Utilities: $200-500/month
- Maintenance: 1-2% of home value annually

On a $400K home, budget an additional $8,000-12,000/year
or $700-1,000/month beyond your mortgage payment."
```

### **"Why You Need an Agent"**
```
"You might wonder: Why not buy directly from the seller or
use the listing agent? Here's why you need your own agent:

1. I negotiate for YOU, not the seller
2. I have access to more listings (some aren't public)
3. I handle paperwork and deadlines (so you don't make mistakes)
4. I recommend other professionals (inspectors, lenders)
5. I'm your advocate throughout the process

And best of all: My commission is paid by the seller,
so representation is free for you!"
```
